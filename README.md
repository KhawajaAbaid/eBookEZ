---> How to install?

-Download the latest release and unzip.
-Run the eBookEZ.exe file (no installation).

Note: Don't be surprised if you see the last copied text in the app's searchbar when you open it, 
that's how its supposed to work! more on that below


--->How to use it?

Go ahead and open an eBook or any pdf file that contains text.

(Note: The app doesn't require you to have a pdf open, you can just copy a word from anywhere, for example a browser, or just type in yourself.)

-Now select and copy a word by using right-click menu or CTRL+C command. You should see the searchbar update and 
now containing the very word you just copied.

-Just click the "Meaning Button" right next to the search bar and give the app 1-3 seconds, it should display definitions (if any)
and synonyms (if any) for that word.

Continue reading your eBook! ;)



---> Developer Notes

The eBookEZ app window is meant to stay on top of every other window you open, 
aka it's the topmost window. Although it doesn't cause focus issues.

You cannot resize the app window, though you can adjust where to place it.
